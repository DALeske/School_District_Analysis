# Module 4 Challenge: School District Analysis

## Overview
The school board has concerns that there may be some academic dishonesty in the Thomas High School ninth grade, casting doubts on the accuracy of reports summarizing district performance for math and reading. The purpose of this analysis is to perform a sensitivity analysisof the school district's math and reading performance, excluding the math and reading scores of ninth-grade children from Thomas High School.

## Methods
Math and reading scores for all ninth graders at Thomas High School were treated as missing data and assigned a value of "NaN". Initial scores were then presented to show successful removal

Once removed, the following analyses were done both before and after removal of ninth graders at Thomas High School:   
    -Math and reading scores summarized
    -Performace summarized for all schools
        -Top 5 performing schools reported based on overall passing rates
        -Bottom 5 performing schools reported based on overall passing rates
    -Performance summarized for the district
        -By per capita spendng: <$584, $585-$629, $630-$644, $645-$675
        -By school size: small (<1000>), medium (1000-2000), large (2000-5000)
